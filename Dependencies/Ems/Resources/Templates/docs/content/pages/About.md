This is a Mathematica documentation website. It provides a collection of ref pages, guides, and tutorials that will help with using the packages at hand. The source notebooks from which it was built may also be used in the Mathematica DocumentationCenter automatically. 

Every ref, tutorial, and guide page, along with providing text and code, has an embedded notebook at the bottom for testing out simple commands.

Similar websites may be built using the  [SimpleDocs](https://github.com/b3m2a1/SimpleDocs) package. 

More info on the construction or usage of this may be obtained by contacting  [the creator of the package](mailto:b3m2a1%40gmail.com) .
